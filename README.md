## Links to papers
Currently, we have explored integrals of powers of two functions :
1) reciprocal of the log function ([direct link to paper](https://github.com/km-git-acc/power-integrals/blob/main/log_power_integrals/An%20exploration%20of%20integrals%20of%20powers%20of%20the%20reciprocal%20of%20the%20log%20V1d1.pdf))
2) zeta function ([direct link to paper](https://github.com/km-git-acc/power-integrals/blob/main/zeta_power_integrals/Roots%20of%20integrals%20of%20powers%20of%20the%20zeta%20function%20V1d1.pdf))

## Summary of key results
1) Discovery of new constants that can be interpreted as generalizations of the Ramanujan-Soldner constant (RS=1.451369..)
     | exponent q | root of L(q,x)=0 |
     |------------|------------------|
     | 0.51       | 1.000669 | 
     | 0.55       | 1.012343 | 
     | 0.6        | 1.039038 |  
     | 0.8        | 1.211222 | 
     | 1.0        | 1.451369 | 
     | 1.5        | 2.349101 | 
     | 2.0        | 3.846468 |
     | 2.5        | 6.319568 |
     | 4.5        | 46.451592|   
     We also observe root_(q+1)/root_q -> exp(1) = 2.71828.. as q gets larger 

     | exponent q | root of Zi(q,x)=0 |
     |------------|------------------|
     | 1.0        | 1.447265 | 
     | 2.0        | 2.476428 | 
     | 3.0        | 2.989319 |
     | 4.0        | 3.416343 |
     In the Zi case, we observe root_(q+1)/root_q -> 1 as q gets larger
