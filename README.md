Currently, we have explored integrals of powers of two functions :
1) reciprocal of the log function ([direct link to paper](https://github.com/km-git-acc/power-integrals/blob/main/log_power_integrals/An%20exploration%20of%20integrals%20of%20powers%20of%20the%20reciprocal%20of%20the%20log%20V1d1.pdf))
2) zeta function ([direct link to paper](https://github.com/km-git-acc/power-integrals/blob/main/zeta_power_integrals/Roots%20of%20integrals%20of%20powers%20of%20the%20zeta%20function%20V1d1.pdf))
